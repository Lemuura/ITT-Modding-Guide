# Installation

## 1. Getting Unreal Engine Source Access
The angelscript integration requires direct changes to unreal engine code to work. You will need to get access to unreal engine source code to be able to access the version of the engine used by It Takes Two.

To get source code access, follow this guide from Epic Games: 
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github

## 2. Downloading UnrealEngine-Angelscript
You can download a precompiled binary for version 4.26.1 (the closest version to ITT) here:
https://github.com/Hazelight/UnrealEngine-Angelscript/releases/tag/v4.26.1-angelscript

Alternatively you can clone the repository and build the correct engine version from scratch. (this will take a long time).

## 3. Installing the Visual Studio Code Extension
A visual studio code extension with auto-completion and debugging support is available.

Install visual studio code from https://code.visualstudio.com/.

Then install the Unreal Angelscript Extension from the marketplace, or search for 'Unreal Angelscript' in the extensions sidebar within Visual Studio Code.
