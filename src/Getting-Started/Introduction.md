# Introduction

It Takes Two use Angelscript, a full-featured scripting language that is actively developed by Hazelight.
One of the amazing benefits with this is that everything written in Angelscript is fully accessible (and editable) by us in the \ItTakesTwo\Nuts\Script directory! If you remove the precompiled.cache file it will compile everything else in the folder at runtime. That's how we have speedtools :)

The majority of the gameplay in ITT is written in Angelscript, so if you just want to do basic modding to various gameplay functionality you don't need to download the engine or anything like that.

I would highly recommend reading the documentation on Angelscript here: <https://angelscript.hazelight.se/>.
Keep in mind that all the documentation there is up to date with the current version of Unreal Engine. It Takes Two runs on UE 4.26 so there will be some differences. I have done various amounts of testing and have dug around their discord server for some older stuff.
